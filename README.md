# Flow â€“ Browser & Cmd Automater

**Flow** is a personal automation utility designed to simplify repetitive browser and command-line tasks. With Flow, you can define custom browser targets and URL lists to launch all links at once. It also supports executing scripts and terminal commands from any specified path and allows for bulk-importing bookmarks across Chromium-based browsers â€” even across multiple user profiles.
